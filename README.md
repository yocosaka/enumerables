# Enumerable Methods

## About the Project

This project is based on the Odin Project of Enumerable methods.
We created our own methods on to the existing Enumerable module without using original methods and with yield statement or #call method as below:

- #my_each
- #my_each_with_index
- #my_select
- #my_all?
- #my_any?
- #my_none?
- #my_count
- #my_map
- #my_inject
- #multiply_els

#multiply_els is created for testing #my_inject, which multiplies all the elements of the array together by using #my_inject.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
